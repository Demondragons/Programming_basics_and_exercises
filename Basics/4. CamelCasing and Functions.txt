//camel casing is the programming practice of using a capital letter when starting a new word in a variable name, because we cant use spaces.
//Variable names also start with a lower case letter to make them easily recognized as being a variable
//i.e. 
int iAmAVariableName = 0;

//Functions in programming are standardised, reusable ways of handling a certain action, generally with different parameters.
//A function can also return a variable containing the result of the function.

//writing a function takes the following format:
int/*the return type*/ Addition/*the function name*/(int/*parameter type*/ parameter1/*parameter name*/,/*comma to seperate parameters*/ int/*parameter type*/ parameter2/*parameter name*/)
{
    return parameter1/*the parameter name now functions like a variable for the value given in the function call*/ + parameter2;
}
int result1 = Addition(5, 8);/*Calling a function. Note that i dont need to write int before my parameter values*/
Console.WriteLine(result1);
Console.WriteLine("Nested function Addition " +Addition(5, 8)/*a function call*/)/*inside another function call*/;

//functions can also return the void type, meaning they dont have a return statement like above, either having no return at all, or an "empty" return
void /*the return type*/ VoidAddition/*the function name*/(int/*parameter type*/ parameter1/*parameter name*/,/*comma to seperate parameters*/ int/*parameter type*/ parameter2/*parameter name*/)
{
    int sum = parameter1 + parameter2;
    return;
}
Console.WriteLine(VoidAddition(5, 8));/*comment out after reading next line*/
//This function call doesnt work because the return type of the function, void, cannot be turned into a string for the WriteLine function
//However i can still call the function on its own
VoidAddition(5, 8);
//i just dont get any visible or useable result returned, but the calculation still happens


//------------EXERCISES--------------

//E1
//Your first task is to write a function that returns the result of two floats subtracted from each other


//E2
//Next write a function that takes takes two strings as parameters, a firstname and lastname, and returns the full name

            
//E3
//https://programmering.systime.dk/?id=163#c1101 in a function taking the paid amount and the amount to pay as parameters.
//return a string with the amount of different cash types to be returned
//Hint: you will need to either get a bit clever with constructing the string gradually, or save the different ammounts in different variables
