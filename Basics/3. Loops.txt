//Copy contents into a main function

//When we want to repeat something several times in programming, we dont copy paste it, we use loops
//there are two primary types of loops, for loops and while loops

//for loop
//for loops are mostly used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a piece of code

//the following for loop is seperated into multiple lines for the sake of readability, its usually written on one line
for (int i = 0;/*this is the initializing counter, we use i to know how far into the loop we are*/
     i < 5; /*this is the condition, the loop continues so long as this statement remains true*/
     i++ /*this is the incrementing statement, you will almost always be incrementing the same varible you initialized, and almost always by 1*/)
{
	//this is the code that will be repeated some number of times, in this example it will be repeated 5 times
	Console.WriteLine("Hello World " + i);
}

//while loop
//while loops are used when you need to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times
int n = 0;
while(n < 5) //while loops only use the condition, and continue to run until the statement is false, 
//this means you have to make sure that the condition becomes false at some point, or the loop will run forever.
{
	//this is the code that will be repeated some number of times, in this example it will be repeated 5 times
	Console.WriteLine("Hello World " + n);
	n++;
}

//exercises

//E1
//write a for loop that counts from 0 to 99 and displays it in the console

//E2 
//modify the for loop from E1 to count from 1 to 100

//E3
//write a for loop that only counts even numbers from 0 to 100

//E4
//write a while loop that continues to run until a random number generator generates a number greater than 90

//E5
//A bank has asked you to make a program that displays the value of an account with 10000$ in it after every year for
//a 50 year period with a 2% compounding interest
//use a for-loop to complete the task
//afterwards try incorporating a yearly 1000$ deposit into the account
