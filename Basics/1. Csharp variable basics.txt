//COPY THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE INTO THE MAIN FUNCTION

String /*variable type*/ iAmAString /*variable name*/;
//the string variable iAmAString has now been initialized, but currently has nothing in it.
//its not just empty, it's null, it doesn't even have a length of 0, it has no length
//i now never need to write 'String iAmAString' again, i only need to write 'iAmAString' when i want to use it.

iAmAString/*varible name*/ = "hello world"/*new varibale content*/;
//the string variable iAmAString now contains something

//the above two lines can be condensed to
String iAmAString = "hello world";
//I get an error on the line above because im trying to initialize a new string variable with the same name i used earlier,
// you can comment it out to solve this error
//(you can technically do this by having different scopes, but thats generally something to avoid for the sake of readability)

iAmAString = "i have overwritten hello world";
//this line overwrites the previous content in the string variable iAmAString

iAmAString += " but now im adding more";
//using += adds to the string variable iAmAString.
//the above line is functionally identical to
iAmAString = iAmAString + " but now im adding more";
//you can also use -= when working with number variables

//There are many variable types, but the ones you will be mostly working with are:
//bool (boolean (true false))
//int (integer (whole number))
//float (floating point number (not whole numbers))
//string (text)

//EXERCISES


//1

//ask the user for their name and age using 2 sets of Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine commands, and save the responses in appropriate variables
//i.e.

Console.WriteLine("What is your favorite animal");
string response = Console.ReadLine();

//2
//try to save the users age as an integer
//hint Convert.ToInt32(number variable here)   (there are other technically more robust options but this is simplest)
